1.1 Command

> Get-ChildItem: -

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
da---l         11-Jan-21  11:11 AM                shell_magic

It shows both the time and the date when I first "edit" in the folder. I assumed that "Mode" is showing the file type.
Since it's a folder, it is showing da---1. 

Get-ChildItem some_folder: - 

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---l         11-Jan-21  11:11 AM              0 shell_assignment.txt

The length of the characters in the .txt file is shown in the length. The mode for this data is -a---1.
It could mean that -a---1 is defined for .txt file. 

> Get-Alias ls: - 

CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Alias           ls -> Get-ChildItem

They have command type and Name. So Get-Alias is the command to get information the alias. 
An alias following after that command is meant for the Powershell to show information about that particular alias.
Just typing Get-Alias gives me a list of alias.   
ls is regarded as an alias for Get-ChildItem. 

1.2 Getting Some Help

> Get-Help Remove-Item: - 

It shows only partial help. There are aliases stated.  
After updating help, it becomes more detailed with a description which explains how it works. 
There is a remark for further explanation on the Remove-Item, including get-help Remove-Item -detailed. 

> Get-Help Remove-Item - detailed: - 

Examples for how to use the Remove-Item in a directory is stated, along with more specification on its syntax. 

Using 
> Get-ChildItem some_folder* -Include * .txt 
returns the file with a .txt file. 

Using 
> ls *.txt -Recurse -Force 
give me the files with .txt file. It does not show the folder anymore. 
I use 
> ls -Recurse -Force 
before and it listed down both the folders and the files in them.
